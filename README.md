# Board Game Registry

## Project Description 
The Board Game Registry helps to organize board games you own. You can add a board game to your collection with basic information such as name, number of players and length. Each game can also have category tags added. You can search for games within your collection by number of players, length or category. Anyone with a large collection of board games will know the pains going through their shelves to find the right game when their friends come over. The board game registry can help organize their collection and make searching for the perfect game much easier. This project was of interest to me because there are around 40 board games in my house and picking the right board game for the evening often took longer than needed.
